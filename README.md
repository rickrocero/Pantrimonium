# Project 2 Name: Pantrimonium

## Description

- This app allows the user to create an inventory of all food items they have. In the app you can add, view, update, and delete new items. At the same time you can categorize each item and save them in a specific section, such as refrigerator, freezer, or pantry. There is a generated shopping list where items running low or expiring are located and the user can also add, and delete items on that page.
